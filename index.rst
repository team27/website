Abstract
--------

openEHR Explorer is an open-source application to query openEHR CDRs, targeted at developers working in a clinical context. 
Previously, developers did not have a standardised method of querying, and openEHR Explorer was created to solve the problem. 
openEHR Explorer is able to query multiple CDRs concurrently with a single AQL query and federate their results into a table.

Key Features
------------

- Login system to accomodate multiple users with different lists of CDRs.

- Supports authentication of CDRs from multiple vendors.

- One AQL to query one or more CDRs at once and federate results into a table.
