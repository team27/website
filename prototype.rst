First Iteration of Prototype
----------------------------

From the gathrered requirements and the sketches produced, we were able to create our first iteration of a prototype:

Feedback of First Prototype
---------------------------

After we had completed the first prototype of the HCI, we allowed our potential users to experiment with it and give feedback on the first version.

Then, the group once again drew further sketches on a section of the solution that we had previously missed out - manipulation and the visualisation of the results data.


Second Iteration of Prototype
-----------------------------

Using the feedback and the new set of sketches, we were able to build upon the first prototype to expand its features.
