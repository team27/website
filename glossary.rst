EHR
---
Electronic Health Record.

CDR
---
Clinical Data Repository. A place where patients' EHRs are stored.

Federate
--------
Combine data from multiple sources, in this context multiple CDRs.
This is useful for the following requests:

* "I don't care what CDR this data lives in, I just want a list of blood pressures for this patient regardless of whether they were taken at the GP or hospital."
* "Give me every patient with hypothyroidism across 12 London hospitals."
