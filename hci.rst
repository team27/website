HCI - Human Computer Interface
==============================

Initial Sketches
----------------
After we had gathered the requirements from the client and the users, we started sketching possible solutions prior to the creation of the first iteration of a prototype individually to increase the chances of each member devising a unique solution.
Once the sketches were completed by all three members, we compared the results to come up with a version that we used to create the first iteration of the prototype.
