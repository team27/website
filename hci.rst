HCI - Human Computer Interaction
================================

Initial Sketches
----------------
After we had gathered the requirements from the client and the users, we started sketching possible solutions prior to the creation of the first iteration of a prototype individually to increase the chances of each member devising a unique solution.
Once the sketches were completed by all three members, we compared the results to come up with a version that we used to create the first iteration of the prototype.

Personas Created
----------------
The team created two personas.

* The first persona is of an experienced developer

* The second persona is of a developer who is not yet familiar with the medical industry.

First Iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the gathrered requirements and the sketches produced, we were able to create our first iteration of a prototype:

Feedback
________

After we had completed the first prototype of the HCI, we allowed our potential users to experiment with it and give feedback on the first version.

Then, the group once again drew further sketches on a section of the solution that we had previously missed out - manipulation and the visualisation of the results data.


Second Iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the feedback and the new set of sketches, we were able to build upon the first prototype to expand its features.
